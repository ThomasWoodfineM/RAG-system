Analysis of Pizza Consumption Trends:
The data reveals interesting patterns in pizza consumption across our test subjects. Sam, who initially consumed no pizzas in 2020, showed a significant increase in consumption from 2021 onwards, with a preference for Margherita and Pepperoni pizzas. Andy maintained a relatively consistent, albeit lower, pizza consumption throughout the study period. Emma and Oliver, our additional test subjects, demonstrated more stable consumption patterns from the beginning, with Emma showing a slight increase over time and Oliver maintaining a steady consumption rate.

Notably, vegetarian pizzas were consistently the least consumed across all subjects, which could indicate a preference for meat-based toppings among our test group. This information could be valuable for pizza vendors in menu planning and inventory management.

Analysis of Pizza Purchase Trends:
Pizza purchase patterns show some interesting divergences from consumption patterns. Sam's purchases increased significantly from 2021 onwards, matching his increased consumption. Andy's purchases remained steady, slightly higher than his consumption, possibly indicating some wastage or sharing. Emma and Oliver maintained consistent purchasing patterns, with Emma showing a slight increase in 2022 and 2023.

Notably, all subjects purchased vegetarian pizzas less frequently than other types, aligning with the consumption data. This consistent pattern across purchase and consumption data reinforces the observation about preference for meat-based pizzas among our test group.

Analysis of Soup Purchase Trends:
Soup purchase patterns generally aligned closely with consumption patterns, indicating efficient inventory management by our test subjects. Sam and Andy showed a slight increase in tomato soup purchases in 2022, possibly due to a promotion or change in preference. Emma's purchases perfectly matched her consumption pattern, showing a strong preference for tomato soup. Oliver's purchases also closely mirrored his consumption, with a clear preference for chicken noodle soup.

### 2.2 Beverage Purchases

#### 2.2.1 Water Purchases

Our test subjects primarily consumed tap water, so no significant purchases were recorded for water consumption.

Analysis of Juice Purchase Trends:
Juice purchase patterns remained remarkably consistent throughout the study period for all subjects. This stability in purchasing behavior contrasts somewhat with the slight variations seen in consumption patterns, particularly for Sam and Emma. This could indicate that our subjects tend to buy juice in regular quantities regardless of small fluctuations in their consumption habits.

The preference for orange juice over apple juice is reflected in the purchasing patterns of Sam, Andy, and Emma, while Oliver's preference for apple juice is clear in his purchasing behavior. This alignment between purchase and consumption patterns suggests that our subjects have a good understanding of their juice preferences and consumption habits.

## Conclusion

This expanded report provides a comprehensive view of the consumption and purchasing patterns of our test subjects over a four-year period. The inclusion of more detailed data and additional test subjects allows for a more nuanced analysis of trends and preferences.

Key observations include:
1. A general preference for meat-based pizzas over vegetarian options.
2. Seasonal variations in soup consumption, with higher intake during colder months.
3. Stable water consumption patterns with a slight increasing trend.
4. Consistent juice purchasing patterns despite some variations in consumption.
5. Close alignment between soup purchases and consumption, indicating efficient inventory management.

These insights could be valuable for food manufacturers, retailers, and marketers in understanding consumer behavior and tailoring their strategies accordingly. Further studies could explore the reasons behind these patterns and how they might be influenced by factors such as pricing, marketing, or health trends.
